Each year the CLICK' Living Lab collaborates with an industrial partner to work on a longer-term pilot project. The aim of this collaboration, which lasts about a year, is to offer research and development work on problems directly related to industry and the technological expertise present in the CLICK' Living Lab. It is also an opportunity for companies to see (and test via prototypes!) the know-how of CLICK' but also to use these technologies for their own projects.

For 2020-21, this pilot project, which goes by the sweet name of "GATPHI" for "Game Arena with Tangible Physical Interaction", is dedicated to interactions with objects and/or people via touch and proprioception, in a virtual reality environment. CLICK's gaming partner company is Virtual Park, a virtual reality park located in Tournai. Last February, the Living Lab team informed us, through a first internal prototype test, of its progress in this very promising project. Find out more about this project in the video below (in French).

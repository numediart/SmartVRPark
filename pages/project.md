Project Context & Goal:

![Multi-user VR interaction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/numediart/SmartVRPark/main/assets/img/smartvr_virg_arms.jpg =200x){: .rounded .float-left}

The SmartVRPark Project comes at a crucial time for VR applications, a time when we are moving from a heavy personal local system (Local VR) to a partly delocalised system on the Cloud (Cloud VR) with computational capabilities in the headset, very high speed wireless transmission and a very good quality of service that introduces minimum delays or loss of information.
The project partner is Virtual Park, the biggest European virtual gaming park.

Virtual reality parks have been developing recently, with a variety of VR games on offer. The most advanced (and the most attractive) games are collaborative, allowing one or more teams of players to compete with robots or with each other, in a virtual space linked to the physical space in which they are actually evolving in strong immersion.   

However, conducting this type of collective interactive experience still involves the use of heavy and expensive equipment, such as portable computers (hidden in a backpack) connected to the VR headset, which also means that this equipment has to be constantly recharged between two games. Moreover, the games available for this type of application are limited in number and are owned by large international groups.

At the same time, the involvement of deep learning-based AI in the field of gaming is only just beginning to open up. Applications can be found in the regulation of games, or in the control of artificial entities participating in the game in the same way as human players.

The objective of this project is to develop a full-scale test platform, in the premises of the industrial partner (in a 500mÂ² space not yet used by the public of Virtual Park), in which players will no longer have to wear heavy, rechargeable suits, and which will involve AI both in the design of the game and in its interaction with the users and between the users and the environment.
Applications of this project could be also found in training or simulation especially in dangerous situations.

Project Actions :

![Project partners](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/numediart/SmartVRPark/main/assets/img/smartvr_actions.jpg)
_SmartVRPark four research actions to achieve the goal._

In this context, the project involves four main actions : 
* BODY TRACKING : track the VR headsets, the other players skeletons and additional objects in the same 3D coordinates to be able to see the other players evolving around with their items.  
* EYE TRACKING : predict or analyse people gaze to reduce the streaming resolution out of the gazed areas and modify the game difficulty by adding ennemies in gazed (or not gazed areas). 
* COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK : manage the computation load between the headset and the cloud/server and their communication wihout introducgin additional lags in the interaction. 
* WIRELESS COMMUNICATION : optimize WIFI 6 networks to manage up to 20 (10 people with two eyes each) 4K streams for muti-player games with minimal lag.
